Overview:

I used to work in retail and it was always annoying when the POS shut down because we had to write everything by hand. When I worked supporting POS systems I worked with managers constantly complained about not having a backup. I want to make a simple POS(Point Of Sale) app that is easy to edit. It should have a front end

User stories

As a boy scout I want to be able to select an item and have it added  to the total price because doing it by hand is slow and inaccurate.

I own a small store and I need the report function to tell me how many of each item was ordered and sales because I need to know what to stock.

As a fast food franchisee I need a backup POS that I can save items and prices to for when the registers go down.
